# Data analysis and reproducible report for:  Proteome alterations in human autopsy tissues in relation to time after death

This repository contains the code and reproducible report for the analysis of protein abundance in autopisied tissue and its association with time of degradation.

We hereby share the code and associated visualizations for the identification of proteins with pseudo-increased or -decreased abundance after time of tissue degradation.  Tissues from kidney, liver and lung were taken from human corpses. Proteins with particular behavior across time were identified using linear models (as implemented in the R packagte `limma`)

## Full reproducible report:

The compiled reproducible report containing the data processing, exploratory, linear model analyses and visualizations can be found in the [link](https://github.com/MiguelCos/Necrodegradomics/blob/main/results/necrodegreadomics_data_analysis_reproducible_report.md).
