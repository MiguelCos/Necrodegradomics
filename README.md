# Necrodegradomics
Identification of proteins with pseudo-increased or -decreased abundance after time of tissue degradation. Tissues from kidney, liver and lung were taken from human corpses. Proteins with particular behaviorm across time were identified using linear models (as implemented in the R packagte `limma`)
